# big-data-case-study
Hello there!
This is, like the name suggests, a big data case study. This is an integration of Kafka, Spark, HDFS, Hive and Power BI. The main theme is to listen to what people are saying about a certain brand, trend or hashtag, do simple sentiment analysis on the tweets then reply accordingly and appropriately. After that, we save the data for further analysis.
The pipeline goes like as follows:
 - First, we gather data from twitter using the Twitter API.
 - Then we send the stream of data to Spark using Kafka.
 - After that we do some simple sentiment analysis on Spark, reply to the tweets and save parquet files to HDFS.
 - Finally, we store the data in a Hive table to be loaded by Microsoft Power BI for analysis and visualization.
In this repository, you will find the producer and consumer scripts, the ODBC driver for connecting Hive with Power BI and a walkthrough of the setup of this project.
Feel free to contact me if you have got any inquiries.
